     *   Tied = 2,
     *   Won = 3.
     * Did Not Finish: The player was not present when the match ended.
     * Lost: The player was on a team that was assigned a loss, typically this is
     * when a team does not have rank = 1.
     * Won: The player was on the team that was assigned the win, typically this is
     * the team that has rank = 1.
     * Tied: The player was on the team that was awarded a tie. Typically this is
     * when the player is on the team with rank = 1, and there is at least one
     * other team with rank = 1. Ties are only for rank = 1 teams. Consider the
     * scenario when exactly one team is rank = 1, and two teams are rank = 2.
     * Players on the rank=1 team will have "Won", players on the rank = 2 teams
     * will have "Lost". For ties, this documentation states 'typically' because
     * the game may have unique rules for multi-team and FFA scenarios, in which
     * multiple teams are awarded a win.
